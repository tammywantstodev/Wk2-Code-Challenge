#Interactive Shopping List

##index.html
This file contains the static structure of the shopping list appliction. It features content such as ``forms`` and ``buttons`` that create a means for users to interact with the application visually.

##index.css
This file contains all the styling for the HTML content and dictates how various elements will appear when rendered on a browser.

##index.js
This file contains the code that allows the functionality of the shopping list application. It does 3 things. One, it allows the user to type in an item in the input box then see it added to their shopping list when they click the ``submit`` button. Secondly, once a user is ready to mark off an item from their list, they just need to click the ``Mark Purchased`` button and the program will put a strikethrough and blur the item to indicate it is no longer on the list. Finally, does the user wish to clear their shopping list, they can use the ``Clear List`` button at the bottom and the items will be cleared.

##Prerequisites
Node.js installed on your machine
Clone the repository ``git clone<ssh code>``
Run the HTML file in your browser
